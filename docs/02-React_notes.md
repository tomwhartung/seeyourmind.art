This `README` file contains notes about the React code in this project.

This file is a copy of the `README-React_notes.md` file from:

- The `whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders` project

This project is in the `always_learning_javascript` repo.

# 1. General Notes

## 1.1. Local Storage

This project saves the images and the values used to create them in the
browser's local storage.

- All code using local storage is in `src/lib/jungian/LocalStorageLib.tsx`
- All functions using local storage have names with the following prefixes:
  - Functions that store values are named `store*`
    - For example, `storeScoreValueArr`, `storeImageStr`
  - Functions that retrieve values are named `getStored*`
    - For example, `getStoredScoreValueArr`, `getStoredImageStr`

## 1.2. React Features

To allow users to save the values and images in the browser's local storage and
enable them to see changes to these images *in real time,* this project uses the
following features of React:

- State variables
  - Maintain the current state of controls used to change the image
  - The names of all state variables begin with the `current` prefix
    - For example, `currentScoreValueArr`, `currentImageStr`
- Event handlers
  - Handle changes to these controls
  - The names of all event handlers begin with the `handle` prefix
    - For example, `handleScoreValueChange`, `handleImageClick`
- `useEffect()` calls or *"hooks"*
  - Store and get values in local storage

All state variables, event handlers, and `useEffect()` calls are in each page's
main container, i.e.:

- The `FixedContainer` component in `src/jungian/Create.tsx`
- The `DFlexContainer` component in `src/jungian/View.tsx`
- The `FixedContainer` component in `src/jungian/Refine.tsx`

The remainder of this file explains how this App uses these features.

## 1.3. Overview of Process

State variables, event handlers, and `useEffect()` calls usually operate as follows:

1. The user manipulates a control
2. This fires the event handler
3. The event handler updates the corresponding state variable
4. Changing a state variable fires the corresponding `useEffect()` call
5. The `useEffect()` call stores the new value in local storage
  - An exception occurs when `Create.tsx`'s `draw()` function stores a new `imageStr`

I developed this technique by adding numerous `console.log()` statements to the code
and watching the console in the Chrome developer tools to see the flow of control
within the components.

## 1.4. Fixing Problems

My preferred technique for solving problems is to add `console.log()` statements that
allow me to trace the flow of logic.
This logic flow is not always intuitive and straight-forward in React programs,
but it starts to make sense after awhile.

- The `useEffect()` calls were particularly counter-intuitive for me, at least at first

The `console.log()` statements also let me see the current values of variables.

- A test for `logLogicFlow` surrounds all `console.log()` statements
- To suppress this `console.log()` output, set `logLogicFlow` to `false` in *all* source files

Note that many `console.log()` statements are commented-out, enabling them to be easily
re-activated as necessary.

# 2. Problems Encountered and Solved

## 2.1. Default Values Wiping out Values in Local Storage

### 2.1.1. Symptoms

During testing I would:

1. Set values on the Create page
2. See the values on the View and Refine pages, and in local storage
3. Reload the app
4. See the values in local storage reset to their default values

### 2.1.2. Cause

This issue was caused by:

- Specifying *valid* "default" values for state variables
- My React code saved these to local storage before the `useEffect()` call would read the saved values

### 2.1.3. Fix

I fixed this issue by:

- Making the distinction between *initial* values and *invalid* values
- Ensuring the local storage functions would *not* save *invalid* values
- Using the *invalid* values as the "default" (React's term) for state variables
- Using the *initial* values when there were no values in local storage

## 2.2. Values Lagging on Different Pages

### 2.2.1. Symptoms

During testing I would:

1. Set values on the Create page
2. See the values on the View or Refine page
3. Change the values on the Create page
4. Sometimes see the *old* values on the View or Refine page

In particular, this can happen after reloading the app then immediately visiting View or Refine.

### 2.2.2. This Bug Came Back!

As I recall, these issues arose *before* I started storing values in local storage, and
I fixed them by adding state variables to the View and Refine pages.

The issue was also probably before I added code to the Refine page supporting controls that
allowed changing the image, which required adding state variables to the page as well.

- Using state variables helped ensure React would re-render the components displaying the values
- This would ensure these components had the latest values from storage or set by the user

### 2.2.3. The Definitive Cause

I re-introduced this bug when trying to remove the `currentScoreValueArr` state variable from
the View page!

- The View page has no controls allowing changes to the image
- I thought that meant I did not need this state variable
- I reproduced this bug by doing the following:

1. Removing the `currentScoreValueArr` state variable from the View page
2. Creating a new image and thus setting new values in the `scoreValueArr`
3. **Reloading** the app, then immediately visiting the View page

This caused the View page to display the `initial*` values, rather than the stored values!

**Note:** this *did not wipe out* the values in local storage, it just caused them to lag.

- I believe the bug was caused by React failing to re-render `DFlexImageAndSliderValues`

### 2.2.4. The Definitive Fix

I was able to fix the last manifestation of this bug by adding the `currentScoreValueArr`
state variable back into the the View page's `DFlexContainer` component.

For details, see the lengthy comment at the top of `DFlexContainer` in `View.tsx`.


# 3. Controls, State Variables, and Event Handlers

All state variables have been *"lifted up"* into each page's main container,
enabling child components to share these values.

## 3.1. Controls, State Variables, and Event Handlers in `Create.tsx`

The Create page in `Create.tsx` supports using the following controls to create an image:

- Four score value sliders:
  - State variable: `currentScoreValueArr`
  - Event handler: `handleScoreValueChange`
  - Local storage item name: `jungian.scoreValueArr`
- Grid size slider:
  - State variable: `currentGridSize`
  - Event handler: `handleGridSizeChange`
  - Local storage item name: `jungian.gridSize`
- Square size slider:
  - State variable: `currentSquareSize`
  - Event handler: `handleSquareSizeChange`
  - Local storage item name: `jungian.squareSize`

## 3.2. Controls, State Variables, and Event Handlers in `View.tsx`

The View page in `View.tsx` allows only viewing an image, not changing it.

- However, without a state variable, values on the View page can lag behind their current values
- For details, see subsection *2.2.3. The Definitive Cause* above

Therefore, even though there are no controls, this page contains the `currentScoreValueArr` state variable.

- No controls:
  - State variable: `currentScoreValueArr`
  - Event handler: *none*
  - Local storage item name: *none*
    - The View page does not store any items, but it does get their values so it can display them

## 3.3. Controls, State Variables, and Event Handlers in `Refine.tsx`

The Refine page in `Create.tsx` supports using the following controls to refine an image:

- Four color picker radio buttons:
  - State variables: `currentColorIndex` and `currentImageStr`
  - Event handler: `handleColorPickerChange`
  - Local storage item name: None, but ultimately enables changing `jungian.imageStr`
- Clicking on image:
  - State variable: `currentImageStr`
  - Event handler: `handleImageClick`
  - Local storage item name: `jungian.imageStr`
- Square size slider:
  - State variable: `currentSquareSize`
  - Event handler: `handleSquareSizeChange`
  - Local storage item name: `jungian.squareSize`
- Image and color picker:
  - State variable: `currentStatusMsg`
  - Event handlers: `handleColorPickerChange` and `handleImageClick`
  - Local storage item name: *none*


# 4. `useEffect()` Hooks

The following files contain `useEffect()` calls:

- `src/jungian/Create.tsx`
- `src/jungian/View.tsx`
- `src/jungian/Refine.tsx`

Some of these `useEffect()` calls contain several lines of code but actually do very little.
This is because I like to use `console.log` statements to trace the flow of control
and see values as they change.

## 4.1. "First `useEffect()`"

The "First `useEffect()`" calls in `Create.tsx`, `View.tsx`, and `Refine.tsx` are fairly similar
to one another:

- Contains an empty dependency array
  - This means they are supposed to run only once, when the component mounts
    - Adding `console.log` statements proves this is not true in code that is not in production
    - For an explanation of this behavior, see:
      - https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#my-effect-runs-twice-when-the-component-mounts
- Reads values from local storage and sets these in:
  - The `ImageLib` variables
  - State variables, as appropriate

## 4.2. Subsequent `useEffect()` Calls in `Create.tsx`

The Create page contains the following additional `useEffect()` calls:

- `useEffect()` with `currentScoreValueArr` in the dependency array
  - Updates local storage with the new `scoreValueArr`
- `useEffect()` with `currentGridSize` in the dependency array
  - Updates local storage with the new `gridSize`
- `useEffect()` with `currentSquareSize` in the dependency array
  - Updates local storage with the new `squareSize`

## 4.3. Subsequent `useEffect()` Calls in `View.tsx`

The Create page contains *no* additional `useEffect()` calls!

## 4.4. Subsequent `useEffect()` Calls in `Refine.tsx`

The Refine page contains the following additional `useEffect()` calls:

- `useEffect` with `currentImageStr` in the dependency array
  - Updates local storage with the new `imageStr`
- `useEffect()` with `currentGridSize` in the dependency array
  - Updates local storage with the new `gridSize`
- `useEffect()` with `currentSquareSize` in the dependency array
  - Updates local storage with the new `squareSize`

# 5. Final Note: A Disclaimer!

Please note that **I am just starting out!**

The techniques I've settled on using here may not be the best way to use
React, but for the most part they make sense to me.
