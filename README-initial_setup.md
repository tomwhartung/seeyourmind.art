# 1. Commands to Create *"The Whole Shebang"*

**Note:** this summary omits git commands.  You are on your own there!

## 1.1. Optional: Upgrade `npm`

```
npm -v                                                       # Check current version of `npm`
sudo npm install -g npm@latest                               # Upgrade current version of `npm`
```

## 1.2. Create New Project Using Vite, React, TypeScript, and MDB

```
pwd                                          # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/whole_shebang/projects
npm init vite@latest -- --template react-ts  # Use '6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders' for the [project_name]
cd 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders
npm i mdb-react-ui-kit
npm i react-router-dom --save                # New - used for menus we will add later
npm run lint
npm run dev
```

## 1.3. Load Into VSCode

Load the new project directory into VSCode and use Shift-Ctrl-M to ensure there are no problems.

## 1.4. Commit to Github

```
pwd          # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/
git add whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/
git commit -m 'Adding whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/ , which contains the latest npm versions of the packages needed for this project.'
```

# 2. Add MDB Navbars and Hello-world-esque Components

We start by copying the Navbars and trivial components used in `whole_shebang/projects/4-wsw_navbar/`.

## 2.1. Copy the `index*.html` Files

The `index*.html` files contain the home page's top menu options:

- Home icon
- En - Pages in English
- Es - Pages in Spanish
- Fr - Pages in French

**We will update these later.**
For now, run the following commands to copy them as-is.

```
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/whole_shebang/projects/
ls -al 4-wsw_navbar/index*.html
cp 4-wsw_navbar/index*.html 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/
cp 4-wsw_navbar/src/favicon.ico 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/
cd ../..
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/
git add whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/
git commit -m 'Copied the whole_shebang/projects/4-wsw_navbar/index*.html files to whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/ .'
```

## 2.2. Copy the Language-Specific Files

These files define the trivial components we use for testing the menus.

### 2.2.1. Copy the English `4-wsw_navbar/src/en/*` Files

```
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/whole_shebang/projects
ls -al 4-wsw_navbar/src/en/
cp -r  4-wsw_navbar/src/en/ 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/
cd ../..
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/
git add whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/en/
git commit -m 'Copied the English language files in whole_shebang/projects/4-wsw_navbar/src/en/ to whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/en .'
```

### 2.2.2. Copy the Spanish `4-wsw_navbar/src/es/*` Files

```
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/whole_shebang/projects
ls -al 4-wsw_navbar/src/es/
cp -r 4-wsw_navbar/src/es/ 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/
cd ../..
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/
git add  whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/es/
git commit -m 'Copied the Spanglish language files in whole_shebang/projects/4-wsw_navbar/src/es/ to whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/es .'
```

### 2.2.3. Copy the French `4-wsw_navbar/src/fr/*` Files

```
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/whole_shebang/projects
ls -al 4-wsw_navbar/src/fr/
cp -r 4-wsw_navbar/src/fr/ whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/
cd ../..
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/
git add whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/fr/
git commit -m 'Copied the French language files in whole_shebang/projects/4-wsw_navbar/src/fr/ to whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/fr .'
```


## 2.3. Copy the `src/main*.tsx` Files

```
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/whole_shebang/projects
l 4-wsw_navbar/src/main*
cp  4-wsw_navbar/src/main* 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/
cd ../..
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/
git add  whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/main*
git commit -m 'Copied the whole_shebang/projects/4-wsw_navbar/src/main* files to whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/ .'
```

## 2.4. Copy the `src/App*.tsx` Files

These files provide "Hello world" text on the home page for each language.

- Note that this text remains visible after clicking on the time-related options in the top menu for each language-specific page

```
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/whole_shebang/projects
l 4-wsw_navbar/src/App*.tsx
cp 4-wsw_navbar/src/App*.tsx 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/
cd ../..
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/
git add whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/App*
git commit -m 'Copied the whole_shebang/projects/4-wsw_navbar/src/App*.tsx files to whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/ .'
```

## 2.5. Copy the `src/*.css` Files

These files provide some basic styles for the App.

```
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/whole_shebang/projects
l 4-wsw_navbar/src/*.css
cp 4-wsw_navbar/src/*.css 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/
cd ../..
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/
git add whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/*.css
git commit -m 'Copied the whole_shebang/projects/4-wsw_navbar/src/*.css files to whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/ .'
```

## 2.6. Cleanup Logo Cruft

Ensure there are no lingering references to `*.svg` files, and delete the ones installed by `npm`

```
cd 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders
pwd                              # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders
grep svg index.html src/*.*
git rm public/vite.svg src/assets/react.svg
cd ../../..
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/
git commit -m 'Removed whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/public/vite.svg and whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/assets/react.svg because they are crufty and unneeded.'
```

## 2.7. Check for Differences

Run the following series of `diff` commands to ensure we haven't forgotten anything:

- It's ok to ignore differences in files like `.eslintrc.cjs` and `package*.json`
  - These are no doubt due to having run `npm install` at different times
  - That is why it's best to start each new project fresh
- I don't know why there's a `README.md` file in `whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/` ...
  - ... but *not* one in `whole_shebang/projects/4-wsw_navbar/`
  - *Not* going to worry about this, becuase `README.md` is *not a source file*

```
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/whole_shebang/projects

diff 4-wsw_navbar/ 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/
diff 4-wsw_navbar/src/ 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/
diff 4-wsw_navbar/src/en/ 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/en
diff 4-wsw_navbar/src/es/ 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/es
diff 4-wsw_navbar/src/fr 6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/fr
```

## 2.8. Sanity Checks

- [x] Check VSCode
  - [x] Press **Ctrl+Shift+M** or click on [Menu icon ->] View -> Problems
  - [x] Give it a little time to analyze all the code and check for issues
- [x] Run `npm run lint` inside the `6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders` directory
- [x] Run `npm run dev` inside the `6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders` directory
- [x] Check that the `App` is working in the browser

**Note:** at this point, the App should work just like the App in `whole_shebang/projects/4-wsw_navbar`.

  - Change the text in the `<h1>` tag in all `src/*/Help.txs` files to "This is the Help page"

## 3.7. Update the `src/App*` Files

Update the `src/App*` files:

- [x] 1. Ensure the function name and "export default" statement in each file matches the file name
- [x] 2. Update the `id` attributes of the `div` tags to equal a lowercase version of the file's basename
  - E.g., Use `id="app-big_five"` in the `<div ...>` tag in `AppBigFive.tsx`
- [x] 3. Update the text -- e.g., "Hello, world", etc. -- to something more appropriate

Hopefully you do not need more ** *"detailed instructions"* ** at this point!

```
pwd       # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src
vi App*.tsx
git add App*.tsx
git commit -m '....'   # Replace '....' with a good description of the changes
```

## 3.8. Sanity Checks

- [x] Check VSCode
  - [x] Press **Ctrl+Shift+M** or click on [Menu icon ->] View -> Problems
  - [x] Give it a little time to analyze all the code and check for issues
- [x] Run `npm run lint` inside the `6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders` directory
- [x] Run `npm run dev` inside the `6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders` directory
- [x] Check that the `App` is working in the browser


# 4. Add a Few Basic MDB CSS Classes

In the interest of starting to structure this project for realsies, make a few additional changes.

- Put the two main pieces of code in the `main-*.tsx` files in a `container`
- Each `container` should have at least one `row`

We may want to make these additional changes, but I see no reason to do so right now:

- Each `row` should have one or more `col`s
- In most apps, each `col` probably should have a `card`

As we add the graphics and sliders, we may want to do add some `cols`s and `card`s.

# 5. Add Simplistic Graphics

Add the simplistic graphics from the `2-wsw_graphics` project to the Big 5 and Enneagram options.

# 6. Add a Sun Signs Option

Add a `sun_signs` option based on the code used for the `big_5` and `enneagram` options.

- [x] 1. Add the four standard files to new `src/sun_signs` directory
- [x] 2. Add `src/AppSunSigns.tsx`
- [x] 3. Add `src/main-sun_signs.tsx`
- [x] 4. Create `index-sun_signs.html`
- [x] 5. Add "Sun Signs" option to `index.html`
- [x] 6. Add `app-sun-signs` to `src/App.css`

# 7. Add Graphics and Sliders

Add the graphics and sliders from the `3-wsw_sliders` project to the Jungian option.

## 7.1. Copying Code From `whole_shebang/projects/3-wsw_sliders/src/App.tsx`

### 7.1.1. Add Code to `Create.tsx`

Adding the graphics with the sliders in the `3-wsw_sliders` project is simply a matter of
copying the code over from `whole_shebang/projects/3-wsw_sliders/src/App.tsx`
and into `whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/jungian/Create.tsx`.

This proved to be easy enough, with the only update needed being that `./Canvas.tsx`
is now in `../lib/Canvas.tsx`.

### 7.1.2. Add Code to `View.tsx`

Now that we've added the code to `Create.tsx`, we can add the same code to `View.tsx`.

This proved to be easy enough, but now we have a lot of duplicate code that needs to be refactored!

# 8. Refactoring

Break as much duplicated code as possible out of `src/jungian/Create.tsx` and `src/jungian/View.tsx`.

Guidelines:

- For now, leave the `draw()` function as-is in both
  - We will update this function in `src/jungian/View.tsx` later
- Put any code that might be useful to other quiz types in its own library file
  - For example: `src/lib/SliderLib.tsx`
- Put code looks to be useful only to the Jungian quiz type in `src/lib/Jungian.tsx`
- Rename `src/lib/Canvas.tsx` to `src/lib/CanvasLib.tsx` for consistency

# 9. Splitting up the Two Main Components

The goal is to have:

- The fixed-size image in `src/jungian/Create.tsx`
- The d-flex image in `src/jungian/View.tsx`

The high-level process is:

- [x] 1. Remove the `DFlexContainer` component from `src/jungian/Create.tsx` leaving only the `FixedContainer` component
  - The same goes for children used exclusively by one but not both of the two components
- [x] 2. Remove the `FixedContainer` component from `src/jungian/View.tsx` leaving only the `DFlexContainer` component
  - The same goes for children used exclusively by one but not both of the two components

A detailed process is beyond the scope of this document.


# 10. Utilize Local Storage

## 10.1. The Original Goal

The goal is to:

- In `src/jungian/Create.tsx`, save the data needed to reproduce the image in JavaScript local storage
  - Actually, use the interface provided by React to do this
- In `src/jungian/View.tsx`, use the data stored in JavaScript local storage to reproduce the image
  - Again, use the interface provided by React to do this
  - This image should be read-only, so deactivate the sliders
  - We will probably want to use the Score Scales used in seeourminds.com, but don't worry about that right now

## 10.2. Major Frustrations

I tried creating a new file, `whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/src/JungianPage.tsx`,
which contains the quiz-specific menu and thus a component that is a parent to the `Create.tsx` page and
other pages.

The idea was to get the values from localStorage in this parent component and pass them on to `Create.tsx`
and other pages, as we do with state variables.

- It's clear that this idea will not work
- I can see the values in local storage in Chrome's developer tools and in the useEffect call, but ...
- ... these values somehow get reset to the default values before I can pass them on to the other pages

## 10.3. Final Product

This turned out to be a major effort, and in retrospect I wish I'd done it in a separate project,
because it required making extensive changes.

Detailing the steps taken to get to the final product is impossible, but while reviewing and refining the code that
works I documented the current state of the App's use of React in:

- `whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/README-React_notes.md`

Seriously, that document is much more informative than this one!


# 11. Review and Refinement

In getting the App to work the way I wanted it to, I took some guesses and named identifiers on the fly.
Once I finished I stepped back a bit and made a lot of changes, to remove unnecessary or redundant code
and try out some identifier naming conventions.

As ideas for improvement came to me while still implementing previous ideas, I started keeping a TODO list.
That list is now saved for posterity as:

- `whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/README-List_of_Refinement_TODOs.txt`

Seriously, that document is not really worth much, **the good stuff is in the previously-mentioned:**

- `whole_shebang/projects/6-wsw_navbar_graphics_sliders/README-React_notes.md`


# 12. Done, I Hope!

The functionality in this App is really quite close to what I want for the Jungian quiz type in the final App.
Moreover, these whole_shebang projects are intended to be used as starting points, not as finished products.

- Technically I think we can consider this project to be "completed"!
